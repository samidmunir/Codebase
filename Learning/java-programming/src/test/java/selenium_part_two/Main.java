/*
    Page Object Model (Design pattern)

    A page object model is used as a component in the automation framework.
    - web pages
    - page objects (variables & methods)
    - test scripts

    Variables & methods are stored separated from Test Scripts.
    
    3 benefits:
    - reusability
    - readability
    - maintainability

    Test Scripts have access to Page Object methods.
    - follows OOP (polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance)
