         * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two
         *  non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse
         *  order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
         *  Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
         * 
         * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading
         *  zero, except the number 0 itself.
         * 
         * Example 1
         *  input: l1 = [2, 4, 3], l2 = [5, 6, 4]
         *  output: [7, 0, 8]
         * 
         * Example 2
         *  input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
         *  output: [0]
         * 
         * Example 3
         *  input: l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]
         *  output: [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]
         * 
         * Constraints:
         * - the number of nodes in each linked list is in the range 
         *      [1, 100].
         * - 0 <= Node.val <= 9
         * - it is guaranteed that the list represents a number that
         *      does not have leading zeros.
