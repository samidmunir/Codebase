         * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-
         *  negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse oder, and
         *  each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers
         *  and return the sum as a linked list.
         * 
         * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero,
         *  except the number 0 itself.
         * 
         * Example 1
         *  input: 2 -> 4 -> 3 and 5 -> 6 -> 4
         *  output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
         * 
         * Example 2
         *  input: 0 and 0
         *  output: 0
         * 
         * Example 3
         *  input: 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 and 9 -> 9
         * 
         * It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not
         *  have leading zeros.
